        Lake Macquarie is Australia's largest coastal saltwater lake, stretching across 110 square kilometres just south of Newcastle. With waterfront towns, bushland reserves, and a relaxed lifestyle, the Lake Macquarie region is a fantastic place to live, visit, and stay active. Whether you are a local looking for new things to try or visiting for the weekend, this guide covers the best activities and sports in and around the lake.

      <p class="text-neutral-700">
        Lake Macquarie's calm, sheltered water is ideal for kayaking and stand-up paddleboarding (launch from Warners Bay or Belmont), sailing through Lake Macquarie Yacht Club, fishing for flathead and bream, and swimming at Warners Bay.
