      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-neutral-900 mt-8 mb-4">Table Tennis</h2>
      <p class="text-neutral-700">
        Table tennis is the most accessible racquet sport in Newcastle by a comfortable margin. At PCYC Broadmeadow, Newcastle PCYC Table Tennis Club runs three open sessions every week where anyone can walk in and play. There's no court to book, no equipment to buy, and no membership to sign up for. Your first session is completely free, and after that it's just $8.50-$9.50 per visit.
      </p>
      <p class="text-neutral-700">
        What sets table tennis apart from other racquet sports is the social environment. Because everyone plays in the same room, you naturally rotate opponents and chat between games. It's common for people to come alone and leave knowing half the room. The club has members from their 20s through to their 80s, and beginners are genuinely welcomed — not just tolerated.
      </p>
      <div class="bg-neutral-50 p-6 rounded-lg border border-neutral-200 my-4">
        <p class="text-neutral-700 font-bold mb-2">Newcastle PCYC Table Tennis Club</p>

        </ul>
      </div>
      <p class="text-neutral-700">
        Table tennis is also one of the best sports for brain health. The combination of hand-eye coordination, spin reading, tactical thinking, and quick reactions provides a mental workout that few other sports can match. It's frequently recommended for <a href="/guides/sports-clubs-newcastle" class="text-brand-600 hover:underline">older adults</a> looking to stay mentally sharp while being physically active.
      </p>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-neutral-900 mt-8 mb-4">Tennis</h2>
      <p class="text-neutral-700">
        Tennis is the most established racquet sport in Newcastle, with clubs spread across the city. The National Park Tennis Centre is one of the main hubs, offering public court hire alongside coaching and competitions. Suburban clubs in Merewether, Waratah, Charlestown, and other areas run social tennis sessions, pennant ladders, and junior development programs.
      </p>
      <p class="text-neutral-700">
        The barrier to entry for tennis is moderate. You'll need your own racquet (a decent beginner racquet starts around $80), a can of balls, and you'll need to book a court. Court hire typically runs $15-$25 per session depending on the venue and time of day. Club memberships provide regular access and reduced court fees but involve an upfront cost.
      </p>
      <p class="text-neutral-700">
        Tennis requires a reasonable base level of fitness. The court is large and the ball moves fast, so you'll be doing plenty of running, especially in singles. Doubles is less demanding and more social. If you're a complete beginner, a few coaching lessons are helpful to learn basic technique before joining social hit-ups.
      </p>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-neutral-900 mt-8 mb-4">Badminton</h2>
      <p class="text-neutral-700">
        Badminton is played at several community centres and sports halls around Newcastle. It's a fast, entertaining sport that provides excellent cardio and improves agility. The shuttlecock moves differently from a ball — it decelerates quickly, which means rallies have a unique rhythm that many players find satisfying.
      </p>
      <p class="text-neutral-700">
        To play badminton in Newcastle, you'll generally need to book a court at a community or sports centre. Sessions typically cost $10-$18 for court hire. You'll need your own racquet (starting around $30 for a basic model) and a tube of shuttlecocks. Some centres run social badminton nights where you can drop in and play with others, which is a good way to get started without needing to organise your own group.
      </p>
      <p class="text-neutral-700">
        Badminton is moderately demanding physically. It involves a lot of lunging and quick directional changes, so a basic level of fitness helps. However, at a social level it's perfectly manageable for most people and the basics are easy to pick up.
      </p>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-neutral-900 mt-8 mb-4">Squash</h2>
      <p class="text-neutral-700">
        Squash is the most physically demanding of the four racquet sports. Played in an enclosed court, it involves constant movement, rapid changes of direction, and high-intensity rallies. A 30-minute game of squash burns more calories than almost any other racquet sport. Courts are available at dedicated squash venues and some fitness centres around Newcastle.
      </p>
      <p class="text-neutral-700">
        Court hire for squash typically costs $15-$25 per session. You'll need a racquet ($40-$80 for a beginner model), a squash ball, and protective eyewear is strongly recommended. Booking is essential as courts are shared and time-limited. Squash is primarily a 1v1 sport, so the social aspect is more limited than team-based or club-session formats.
      </p>
      <p class="text-neutral-700">
        If you're already fit and enjoy intense, competitive exercise, squash is an excellent choice. For complete beginners or those returning to sport after a long break, it's worth building a fitness base first or starting with a less demanding racquet sport.
      </p>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-neutral-900 mt-8 mb-4">Which Racquet Sport Should You Choose?</h2>
      <p class="text-neutral-700">
        The right racquet sport for you depends on what you're looking for. Here's a quick decision guide:

      <p class="text-neutral-700">
        For many people, table tennis is the natural starting point because it removes every common barrier — cost, equipment, booking hassles, fitness requirements, and the awkwardness of being a beginner. Once you've got the sporting habit established, you might branch out into other racquet sports as well.
