        Not all exercise needs to leave you sore, breathless, or reaching for the ice pack. <strong>Low-impact sports</strong> offer a way to stay active, healthy, and social without the strain that high-impact activities put on your body. Whether you're recovering from an injury, managing joint pain, getting older, or simply prefer a gentler approach to fitness, Newcastle has a surprising number of options.
      </p>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-neutral-900 mt-8 mb-4">Why Low-Impact Exercise Matters</h2>
      <p class="text-neutral-700">
        High-impact sports like running, basketball, and tennis put significant stress on joints — particularly knees, hips, and ankles. Over time, that stress leads to wear and tear, inflammation, and injury. Low-impact exercise reduces that strain while still delivering real fitness benefits.
      </p>
      <p class="text-neutral-700">
        Low-impact sports are especially important for:

      <p class="text-neutral-700">
        The key insight is that <strong>low-impact doesn't mean low-benefit</strong>. Many low-impact sports provide excellent cardiovascular exercise, improve coordination, and build functional strength — all while being kind to your body.
      </p>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-neutral-900 mt-8 mb-4">Low-Impact Sports Available in Newcastle</h2>
      <p class="text-neutral-700">
        Newcastle and the Hunter region offer a wide range of gentle exercise options. Here's a look at the best ones, with honest pros and cons for each.
      </p>

      <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-neutral-900 mt-6 mb-3">Table Tennis</h3>
      <p class="text-neutral-700">
        Table tennis is one of the best low-impact sports you can play. The movements are controlled and contained — short steps, small lunges, quick arm movements — with virtually no jumping, pounding, or jarring impacts. Yet it still delivers a genuine workout. A typical session burns <strong>270-400 calories per hour</strong>, improves hand-eye coordination, sharpens reflexes, and provides moderate cardio.
      </p>
      <p class="text-neutral-700">
        What makes table tennis especially appealing is that <strong>you control the intensity</strong>. Want a relaxed social hit? Play at a gentle pace. Want to push yourself? Step up the speed and compete. This flexibility makes it suitable for everyone from <a href="/guides/seniors-activities-newcastle" class="text-brand-600 hover:underline">seniors</a> to younger players recovering from sports injuries.
      </p>
      <div class="bg-neutral-50 p-6 rounded-lg border border-neutral-200 my-4">
        <p class="text-neutral-700">
          <strong>Pros:</strong> Very low impact on joints, social and fun, affordable ($9/session), equipment provided, no booking needed, indoor (weather-proof), cognitive benefits.<br/>
          <strong>Cons:</strong> Limited to three sessions per week at PCYC Broadmeadow.
        </p>
      </div>

      <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-neutral-900 mt-6 mb-3">Swimming</h3>
      <p class="text-neutral-700">
        Swimming is the gold standard of low-impact exercise. The water supports your body weight, eliminating almost all joint stress. Newcastle has excellent public pools and ocean baths — from the iconic Bogey Hole to the heated pools at Lambton. Swimming provides a full-body workout that builds cardiovascular fitness, muscular endurance, and flexibility.
      </p>
      <div class="bg-neutral-50 p-6 rounded-lg border border-neutral-200 my-4">
        <p class="text-neutral-700">
          <strong>Pros:</strong> Near-zero joint impact, full-body workout, widely available.<br/>
          <strong>Cons:</strong> Can be solitary, pool fees add up ($8-10 per visit), outdoor pools are weather-dependent.
        </p>
      </div>

      <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-neutral-900 mt-6 mb-3">Lawn Bowls</h3>
      <p class="text-neutral-700">
        Lawn bowls has seen a resurgence in Newcastle, especially among younger players. It's gentle, social, and played at a relaxed pace. Several clubs in the area welcome beginners with barefoot bowls sessions. The physical demands are minimal — mostly walking and bending — making it ideal for people with limited mobility.
      </p>
      <div class="bg-neutral-50 p-6 rounded-lg border border-neutral-200 my-4">
        <p class="text-neutral-700">
          <strong>Pros:</strong> Very gentle, highly social, affordable, beginner-friendly.<br/>
          <strong>Cons:</strong> Limited cardiovascular benefit, outdoor (weather-dependent), club scheduling.
        </p>
      </div>

      <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-neutral-900 mt-6 mb-3">Yoga &amp; Tai Chi</h3>
      <p class="text-neutral-700">
        Both yoga and tai chi focus on controlled movements, flexibility, balance, and mindfulness. Newcastle has numerous studios and community groups offering classes for all levels. These practices are particularly beneficial for people managing stress, chronic pain, or balance issues.
      </p>
      <div class="bg-neutral-50 p-6 rounded-lg border border-neutral-200 my-4">
        <p class="text-neutral-700">
          <strong>Pros:</strong> Excellent for flexibility and balance, calming, adaptable to all abilities.<br/>
          <strong>Cons:</strong> Studio classes can be expensive ($15-25), limited social interaction in some formats.
        </p>
      </div>

      <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-neutral-900 mt-6 mb-3">Walking Groups</h3>
      <p class="text-neutral-700">
        Newcastle's coastline, parks, and bush trails make it ideal for walking. Several community walking groups operate across the region, offering structured, social walks at various paces. Walking is the simplest form of low-impact exercise and requires zero equipment beyond a pair of comfortable shoes.
      </p>
      <div class="bg-neutral-50 p-6 rounded-lg border border-neutral-200 my-4">
        <p class="text-neutral-700">
          <strong>Pros:</strong> Free, social, no equipment needed, adaptable pace.<br/>
          <strong>Cons:</strong> Weather-dependent, limited upper-body workout, can become monotonous.
        </p>
      </div>

      <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-neutral-900 mt-6 mb-3">Cycling</h3>
      <p class="text-neutral-700">
        Cycling is excellent for cardiovascular fitness while being gentle on the knees and hips. Newcastle's Fernleigh Track and the coastal cycleway offer scenic, safe routes. E-bikes have also made cycling more accessible to people who find traditional cycling too demanding.
      </p>
      <div class="bg-neutral-50 p-6 rounded-lg border border-neutral-200 my-4">
        <p class="text-neutral-700">
          <strong>Pros:</strong> Great cardio, easy on joints, scenic routes in Newcastle.<br/>
          <strong>Cons:</strong> Requires equipment (bike, helmet), weather-dependent, road safety concerns.
        </p>
      </div>

        Among all the options listed above, table tennis hits a unique sweet spot. It's one of the few low-impact sports that combines <strong>physical exercise, cognitive stimulation, and genuine social connection</strong> in every single session.

        Table tennis is sometimes called "the best brain sport in the world" because of the rapid-fire decision-making involved in every rally.
