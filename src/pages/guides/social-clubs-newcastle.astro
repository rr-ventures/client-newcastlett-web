      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-neutral-900 mt-8 mb-4">Why Table Tennis Works So Well as a Social Club</h2>
      <p class="text-neutral-700">
        Of all the social club options in Newcastle, table tennis ticks every box. It's one of those rare activities where complete beginners and experienced players can share the same space and genuinely enjoy themselves. Here's why it stands out:
      </p>
      <ul class="space-y-2 my-4">
        <li class="flex items-start">
          <span class="text-brand-600 mr-2">&check;</span>
          <span class="text-neutral-700"><strong>Natural conversation starter</strong> — You're standing across a table from someone, chatting between rallies. Friendships form without any awkward small talk</span>
        </li>
        <li class="flex items-start">
          <span class="text-brand-600 mr-2">&check;</span>
          <span class="text-neutral-700"><strong>All fitness levels</strong> — You control the pace. Play gently or go full speed, it's up to you</span>
        </li>
        <li class="flex items-start">
          <span class="text-brand-600 mr-2">&check;</span>
          <span class="text-neutral-700"><strong>Low impact on joints</strong> — Particularly popular with <a href="/guides/seniors-activities-newcastle" class="text-brand-600 hover:underline">adults over 50</a> who want to stay active without risking injury</span>
        </li>
        <li class="flex items-start">
          <span class="text-brand-600 mr-2">&check;</span>
          <span class="text-neutral-700"><strong>Indoor and weather-proof</strong> — Rain or shine, sessions run year-round in a climate-controlled venue</span>
        </li>
        <li class="flex items-start">
          <span class="text-brand-600 mr-2">&check;</span>
          <span class="text-neutral-700"><strong>Quick to pick up</strong> — Most people can rally within minutes, even if they've never held a bat before</span>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p class="text-neutral-700">
