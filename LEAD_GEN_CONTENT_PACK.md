## SECTION 3: COMMUNITY CONTENT DRAFTS

### 3A: Reddit Reply Templates (Casual, Helpful Tone)

**For "things to do in Newcastle" threads:**
Newcastle has heaps going on depending on what you're into. Beaches are obvious — Merewether and Bar Beach are great. Bathers Way walk is nice. Darby Street for food and coffee. If you want something a bit different, there's table tennis at PCYC Broadmeadow (first session free if you've never been). Fort Scratchley is worth a look too. What kind of stuff are you into?

**For "making friends in Newcastle" threads:**
Honestly the best way I've found is joining something regular — same time each week so you keep seeing the same people. Could be parkrun, a gym class, a sports club, whatever you're into. I know people who've made good mates through table tennis at PCYC Broadmeadow (it's pretty social, mixed ages), or through Meetup groups, or just regularing at the same cafe. Takes a few weeks but it works.

**For "indoor activities" threads:**
For indoor stuff: there's the galleries and museum (both free), bowling, escape rooms, rock climbing at various places. Table tennis at PCYC Broadmeadow is a good option too — cheap, social, and you can just show up without booking. Cinema obviously. What sort of vibe are you after?

**For "evening activities" threads:**
Monday and Wednesday evenings you could try table tennis at PCYC Broadmeadow — runs 6:30-10pm, pretty social crowd. Otherwise there's trivia at various pubs, yoga studios do evening classes, some community centres run workshops. Depends if you want active or chill.

**For "fitness/gym alternatives" threads:**
If you're over gyms, there are loads of alternatives in Newcastle. Ocean swimming, parkrun (free every Saturday), rock climbing, various sports clubs. Table tennis at PCYC is surprisingly good exercise and way more social than a gym — like $9 a session, no contract. Also yoga studios, bootcamps on the beach, cycling groups. What are you looking for specifically?

**For "things for seniors/parents" threads:**
For older folks or lower-impact stuff, table tennis at PCYC Broadmeadow is popular — they've got people from 20s to 80s there and it's pretty gentle on the joints. Lawn bowls clubs do barefoot bowls which is social and easy. Ocean baths for swimming. Walking groups. U3A runs all sorts of courses if you want something more structured.

### 3B: Facebook Group Post Templates

**Discussion Starter:**
What's everyone's go-to weeknight activity in Newcastle? Trying to get out more instead of just Netflix every night. Currently thinking of trying a sport or something regular.

**Helpful Recommendation:**
Someone asked about this the other day — if you're looking for something social and active, table tennis at PCYC Broadmeadow is worth a try. First session free, you don't need your own gear. Runs Monday and Wednesday nights. My [friend/partner/parent] goes and rates it.

**Casual Mention:**
Had a really good hit at table tennis tonight. Forgot how fun it is. If anyone's looking for something to do midweek, PCYC Broadmeadow runs sessions — pretty casual, good mix of people.

### 3C: Quora Answer Templates

**Q: What are some things to do in Newcastle, Australia?**
Newcastle has a lot going for it. The coastline is the main draw — beaches from Nobbys down to Merewether, the Bathers Way coastal walk, ocean baths. Food scene is solid, especially Darby Street and Beaumont Street. For activities: surfing, bushwalking at Glenrock, Fort Scratchley tours, Newcastle Museum and Art Gallery (both free). If you want something active and social, there's a table tennis club at PCYC Broadmeadow that's pretty popular — first session free. Hunter Valley wineries are an easy day trip too.

**Q: How can I meet people in Newcastle?**
The key is finding something regular so you see the same people repeatedly. Parkrun every Saturday is free and social. Sports clubs (table tennis at PCYC Broadmeadow, tennis, bowls, swimming) work well because you interact naturally during play. Meetup.com has Newcastle groups. Volunteering. Regular gym classes. It takes a few weeks of showing up but friendships form. The table tennis club specifically seems to have good social vibes — mixed ages, welcoming to newcomers.

**Q: What are good low-impact sports in Newcastle?**
Swimming is popular — ocean baths at Merewether and Newcastle, plus regular pools. Table tennis at PCYC Broadmeadow is excellent for low-impact exercise with a social element. Lawn bowls at Merewether or Hamilton clubs. Yoga studios across the city. Tai chi groups. Cycling on the Fernleigh Track (flat, 15km). Most of these suit all ages and you can go at your own pace.

## SECTION 7: GA4 SETUP CODE

Once you create your GA4 property at analytics.google.com, you'll get a Measurement ID (format: G-XXXXXXXXXX).

Add this to Layout.astro in the <head> section:

```html
<!-- Google Analytics 4 -->
<script async src="https://www.googletagmanager.com/gtag/js?id=G-XXXXXXXXXX"></script>
<script>
  window.dataLayer = window.dataLayer || [];
  function gtag(){dataLayer.push(arguments);}
  gtag('js', new Date());
  gtag('config', 'G-XXXXXXXXXX');
</script>
```

Replace G-XXXXXXXXXX with your actual Measurement ID.
