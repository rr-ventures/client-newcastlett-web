# Manus Prompt: Meta Ads Library Research

Copy and paste this entire prompt into Manus.

---

## Task

Find 5-10 successful Facebook/Instagram ads from the Meta Ads Library that I can use as templates for a local table tennis club. I need screenshots and copy from real ads that are currently running.

## Instructions

### Step 1: Go to Meta Ads Library

URL: https://www.facebook.com/ads/library/

Set these filters:
- **Location:** Australia
- **Ad category:** All ads
- **Status:** Active (currently running ads = likely working)

### Step 2: Search These Categories

Search for ads using these 3 groups. Skip table tennis/ping pong — no one runs those ads.

**Group 1: Martial Arts & Combat Sports (Australia)**
- "martial arts"
- "boxing gym"
- "BJJ" or "Brazilian jiu jitsu"
- "MMA gym"

**Group 2: Gyms & Fitness Studios (Australia)**
- "fitness studio"
- "gym membership"
- "CrossFit"

**Group 3: Social Sports Clubs (Australia)**
- "sports club"
- "tennis club"
- "squash club"

### Step 3: What to Capture

For each good ad you find, take a screenshot and note:

**Must have:**
- Screenshot of the full ad (image/video thumbnail + all copy)
- The ad creative (what the image/video shows)
- The headline
- The primary text (the main copy)
- The advertiser name

**Nice to have (if visible):**
- How long it's been running (longer = working)
- Platform (Facebook/Instagram/both)
- CTA button text

### Step 4: Selection Criteria

Look for ads that:
- Have been running 30+ days (indicates success)
- Are from LOCAL clubs, not big chains
- Use a free trial or low-commitment offer
- Have simple, clear messaging
- Use real photos of actual members/sessions
- Target adults (not just kids programs)

Ignore:
- National gym chains (Anytime Fitness, F45 corporate)
- Ads that only promote kids classes
- Equipment sales
- Personal trainer ads

### Step 5: Deliverables

Create a PDF with:

**1. Screenshot Gallery (5-10 ads)**
Each ad on its own page with:
- Full screenshot
- The copy written out (in case screenshot is blurry)
- What offer they're using
- What makes this ad work

**2. Copy Swipe File**
A simple list of:
- Headlines that these ads use
- Primary text examples
- CTAs used

**3. Patterns Summary**
Just the facts — what do the winning ads have in common:
- Most common offer type
- Most common creative style
- Most common messaging angle

**DO NOT include:**
- Recommendations for our club
- Suggested ad copy for us
- Strategy suggestions

I just need the raw data and screenshots. I'll figure out what to do with it.

## Output

Single PDF file with all screenshots embedded.
