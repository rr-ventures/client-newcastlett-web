## 1. Newcastle Herald

**To:** newsroom@newcastleherald.com.au (or features editor)
**Subject:** Story idea — 30-year-old Newcastle sports club still going strong

Hi,

I've got a community angle that might interest your readers.

Newcastle PCYC Table Tennis Club has been running at Broadmeadow since 1996 — nearly 30 years of the same community dropping in to play. What's interesting is the range: we've got uni students playing alongside retirees in their 80s, complete beginners matched up with former state-level players. It's the kind of quiet, unglamorous community sport that doesn't make headlines but keeps people connected.

There's been a noticeable uptick in new faces lately — people looking for social activities that aren't apps or gyms. Might make a decent community feature, especially with the angle of intergenerational connection through sport.

Happy to arrange a visit during a session if you'd like to see it in action. Monday/Wednesday 6:30pm or Saturday 2:30pm.

Cheers,

## 2. Hunter Hunter

**To:** hello@hunterhunter.com.au (or editorial)
**Subject:** Local activity for your Newcastle guides

Hi team,

I've been reading Hunter Hunter's coverage of things to do in Newcastle and thought you might want to know about us.

Newcastle PCYC Table Tennis Club is one of those spots that flies under the radar. We've been at PCYC Broadmeadow since 1996 — no flash facilities, just good community sport. First session free, equipment provided, rock up without booking. It's become a go-to for people who want something social and active without gym memberships or team commitments.

Could work well for your "things to do" content, rainy day activities, or that "hidden gems" angle. Let me know if you'd like more info or want to drop by a session.

Thanks,

## 3. Newcastle RSL Club

**To:** [Functions/Community Manager]
**Subject:** Activity idea for RSL members

Hi,

I'm reaching out from Newcastle PCYC Table Tennis Club with an idea that might interest your members.

RSL clubs do a great job bringing people together socially — and we've found table tennis does the same thing in a slightly more active way. A few of our regulars are ex-services, and they've mentioned it's good for staying sharp, getting some exercise, and having a laugh without it being too physically demanding.

We run sessions at PCYC Broadmeadow Monday and Wednesday evenings plus Saturday afternoon. First session is free, we provide all the gear, and there's no booking or sign-up required.

Would you be open to mentioning us in your members' newsletter or noticeboard? Happy to provide a flyer if that helps. It could be a good option for members looking for a regular, low-key activity.

Best,

## 4. Cardiff RSL Club

**To:** [Functions/Community Manager]
**Subject:** Social activity for Cardiff RSL members

Hi,

I wanted to introduce Newcastle PCYC Table Tennis Club as an activity option for your members.

We're just 10 minutes from Cardiff at PCYC Broadmeadow, and we've found RSL members often fit right in — the atmosphere is social, the pace is whatever you want it to be, and it's a good way to stay active without overdoing it.

No need to commit to anything. First session free, equipment provided, just turn up. Sessions run Monday/Wednesday from 6:30pm and Saturday from 2:30pm.

If you'd be willing to share this with members who might be looking for a regular activity, we'd really appreciate it. Happy to drop off some flyers or provide info for your newsletter.

## 5. Wallsend Diggers Club

**To:** [Functions/Community Manager]
**Subject:** Something for Diggers members to do mid-week

Hi,

I run Newcastle PCYC Table Tennis Club at Broadmeadow and wanted to reach out about a potential fit for your members.

We've noticed that club members — particularly those who are retired or have more flexible schedules — often want something to do during the week that's social and gets them moving, but isn't too intense. Table tennis ticks those boxes. It's easy to pick up, doesn't matter if you haven't played since school, and it's more social than solitary.

We run Monday and Wednesday nights (6:30pm) and Saturday arvo (2:30pm). First visit free, all equipment provided.

Would you consider sharing this with your members? Even a quick mention in your newsletter or a flyer on the noticeboard would help. Let me know if you'd like me to send through some info.

Thanks,

## 6. Charlestown Bowling Club

**To:** [Club Manager or Social Coordinator]
**Subject:** Cross-promotion idea — bowling + table tennis

Hi,

I'm from Newcastle PCYC Table Tennis Club, and I wanted to suggest something that might benefit both our clubs.

Bowlers and table tennis players often overlap — they're looking for social sport, something active but not strenuous, and a good community atmosphere. A few of our members are bowlers too, and they've said the two sports complement each other well.

Would you be interested in a simple cross-promotion? We could mention Charlestown Bowling Club to our members, and you could share our details with yours. No cost, no commitment — just helping each other reach people who might enjoy both.

We're at PCYC Broadmeadow, first session free, equipment provided. Happy to send through a flyer or more info.

Let me know what you think.

Best,

## 7. Warners Bay Bowling Club

**To:** [Club Manager or Social Coordinator]
**Subject:** Partner activity for your members

Hi,

I'm reaching out from Newcastle PCYC Table Tennis Club about an idea that could add value for your members.

Bowling club members often enjoy the social, community aspect of sport — and that's exactly what we offer at our table tennis sessions. We're 15 minutes from Warners Bay at PCYC Broadmeadow, and we've got members ranging from 25 to 80+, all playing together.

It's low-impact, social, and a good change of pace from outdoor bowls (especially on wet days). First session free, all equipment provided.

If you'd be open to sharing our details with members — newsletter, noticeboard, or even just word of mouth — we'd be grateful. Happy to return the favour and promote Warners Bay Bowling Club to our players.

Thanks for considering,

## 8. Belmont Bowling Club

**To:** [Club Manager or Social Coordinator]
**Subject:** Indoor option for your members

Hi,

I wanted to connect with Belmont Bowling Club about Newcastle PCYC Table Tennis Club.

We run social table tennis at PCYC Broadmeadow — just 20 minutes from Belmont. It's a good complement to lawn bowls: similar social atmosphere, all skill levels welcome, but indoors (so weather's never an issue).

A few of our members are bowlers, and they've mentioned the hand-eye coordination benefits carry over. Plus, it's something to do on days when the greens aren't available.

We'd be happy to promote Belmont Bowling Club to our members if you'd consider sharing our details with yours. First session free, equipment provided, no booking needed.

Let me know if you'd like more info or a flyer to display.

## 9. Newcastle Men's Shed

**To:** [Coordinator/Secretary]
**Subject:** Activity idea for Men's Shed members

Hi,

I'm from Newcastle PCYC Table Tennis Club, and I wanted to share an activity that might interest your members.

Men's Sheds do great work getting blokes together and keeping them active — we're trying to do something similar with table tennis. It's physical but not demanding, social without the pressure, and you can chat between games. A few of our regulars are Men's Shed types — retired tradies, ex-services, guys who just want something to do mid-week that isn't sitting at home.

We run sessions at PCYC Broadmeadow Monday and Wednesday evenings and Saturday arvo. First visit free, all gear provided, just rock up.

Would you be open to mentioning us to your members? Could be a good option for blokes who want an extra activity during the week. Happy to provide a flyer or drop by to say hello.

## 10. Lake Macquarie Men's Shed

**To:** [Coordinator/Secretary]
**Subject:** Something for the blokes to do between projects

Hi,

I run Newcastle PCYC Table Tennis Club at Broadmeadow, and I thought Men's Shed members might be interested.

Table tennis is a good fit for the Men's Shed crowd — it's active, it's social, and there's no pressure to be good at it. A few of our regulars are in their 70s and 80s, and they reckon it keeps them sharp without being too hard on the body.

We're about 20 minutes from Lake Macquarie, sessions run three times a week, and the first one's free. Equipment provided, no booking needed — just turn up and play.

If you'd consider sharing this with your members, we'd really appreciate it. Happy to send through some info or a flyer.

## 11. Rotary Club of Newcastle

**To:** [Club Secretary or President]
**Subject:** Community activity partnership

Hi,

I'm reaching out from Newcastle PCYC Table Tennis Club about a potential connection with Rotary.

Our club has been part of the Newcastle community since 1996, offering social sport at PCYC Broadmeadow. We share a similar ethos to Rotary — community-focused, welcoming to all, building connections between people who might not otherwise meet.

We've got members from their 20s to their 80s, and table tennis works well as a social equaliser — doesn't matter who you are once you're holding a bat.

I wondered if Rotary might be interested in:
- Sharing our club with members as a local activity option
- A group visit to one of our sessions
- Connecting us with community groups you work with who might benefit

Happy to discuss further or provide info for your bulletin.

Best regards,

## 12. Lions Club Newcastle

**To:** [Club Secretary]
**Subject:** Local activity for Lions members

Hi,

I'm from Newcastle PCYC Table Tennis Club, and I wanted to connect with Lions Club Newcastle.

Lions does tremendous community work, and we're trying to contribute in our own small way — providing affordable, social sport for the Newcastle community. Table tennis is one of those activities that brings together people of all ages and backgrounds, and we've been doing it at PCYC Broadmeadow since 1996.

I thought some Lions members might enjoy a hit — it's good exercise, good conversation, and the first session is free. No commitment, no pressure. Sessions run Monday/Wednesday 6:30pm and Saturday 2:30pm.

Would you be open to sharing this with your members? Happy to provide info or flyers, or discuss how we might support each other.

Thanks for considering,

## 13. Probus Club Newcastle

**To:** [Club Secretary or Activities Coordinator]
**Subject:** Activity suggestion for Probus members

Hi,

I wanted to reach out about Newcastle PCYC Table Tennis Club as an activity option for Probus members.

Table tennis is ideal for active retirees — it's low-impact, keeps the reflexes sharp, and is more social than most sports. We have members in their 70s and 80s who play regularly, and they often say it's the highlight of their week.

Our sessions run at PCYC Broadmeadow on Monday and Wednesday evenings (6:30pm) and Saturday afternoons (2:30pm). First session is free, equipment provided, and there's no booking required.

Would Probus be interested in a group outing to try a session? Or if you'd prefer, I could send through information to share in your newsletter. Either way, I think your members would enjoy it.

## 14. TAFE Newcastle (Tighes Hill Campus)

**To:** Student Services or Student Association
**Subject:** Free activity option for TAFE students

Hi,

I'm reaching out about a low-cost activity for TAFE Newcastle students.

Newcastle PCYC Table Tennis Club runs drop-in sessions at PCYC Broadmeadow — just a few minutes from Tighes Hill campus. It's social, it's active, and it's affordable: first session free, then just $8.50-$9.50 with no memberships or lock-ins.

For students balancing study, work, and budget, it's a good option to destress and meet people without the commitment or cost of a gym.

Sessions run Monday and Wednesday evenings (6:30pm) and Saturday arvo (2:30pm). Equipment provided, no booking needed.

Would you be able to share this with students? Happy to provide digital or print info for noticeboards, newsletters, or social media.

## 15. University of Newcastle (Sport & Recreation)

**To:** UoN Sport or Student Life
**Subject:** Club partnership — table tennis at PCYC Broadmeadow

Hi,

I'm from Newcastle PCYC Table Tennis Club, and I wanted to connect with UoN Sport about a potential partnership.

We run community table tennis sessions at PCYC Broadmeadow — close to both Callaghan and Newcastle campuses. For students looking for sport outside the uni system, we offer something pretty accessible: first session free, equipment provided, no booking, no commitment.

It's also a way for students to meet people outside the uni bubble — we've got members of all ages, and table tennis is a great equaliser.

Would UoN be interested in:
- Sharing our club via student channels
- A formal club affiliation or referral arrangement
- A group session for students to try it out

Happy to discuss what works best.
