If you're after something a bit different, there's a table tennis club at PCYC Broadmeadow. It's pretty casual — just rock up Monday/Wednesday arvo (6:30pm) or Saturday (2:30pm), they provide the bats. First session's free. Good mix of people, from uni students to retirees. Been going for a few months now and it's become my regular thing.

I moved here a couple of years ago and found it hard to meet people outside of work. What actually worked for me was joining a sports club — specifically the table tennis club at PCYC Broadmeadow. It sounds random but hear me out: you chat between games, everyone's pretty friendly, and it's low commitment (just show up when you can, no team obligations). First session's free if you want to suss it out. Monday/Wednesday 6:30pm or Saturday arvo.

PCYC Broadmeadow has a table tennis club if you want something active but indoors. It's not fancy but it's good fun — they run sessions Monday, Wednesday (evening) and Saturday arvo. Equipment provided, first go is free. Decent way to burn some energy when the weather's rubbish.

**Post:**
Table tennis at a local PCYC is underrated. I pay like $8.50 a session (no membership lock-in), equipment's provided, and it's genuinely social. Way cheaper than a gym and more fun imo. Check if your local PCYC runs sessions — I go to the one in Newcastle and it's been great.

My dad (late 60s) started going to the table tennis club at PCYC Broadmeadow and loves it. Low impact, social, and he reckons it keeps his reflexes sharp. They've got people from their 20s to their 80s so he doesn't feel out of place. Might be worth suggesting to your folks. First session's free and they provide bats.

If anyone in Lake Mac is looking for a social sport that's not too intense, there's a table tennis club at PCYC Broadmeadow (about 15-20 min from most of Lake Mac). Good mix of ages, very casual atmosphere. My partner and I started going together and it's become our regular Wednesday night thing. First session free, equipment provided.

Hi all, just wanted to mention the table tennis club at PCYC Broadmeadow for anyone looking for a gentle, social activity. I'm in my 60s and was worried I'd be the oldest there, but they've got members well into their 80s! Table tennis is great for keeping the mind sharp and it's easy on the joints. They run sessions Monday and Wednesday evenings and Saturday afternoon. First one's free, bats provided. Worth a look if you want to stay active and meet people.
